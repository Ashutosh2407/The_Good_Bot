# The_Good_Bot

The Good bot is an encouragement bot which sends encouraging messages to the users who send sad, depressing messages in the discord group chats. It also sends an inspiring quote when you 
type the command "$inspire".

The bot also allows users to add their own encouraging messages in the database by giving the command "$new" followed by the message.
